# SE_Day1
Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering entails the systematic application of engineering principal, methodologies, techniques to developing and maintaining quality software products.

Software engineering enables the development of software applications and systems which are useful in all areas of human endeavors.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Evolution of programming languages eg C++, FORTRAN etc
- The advent of structured programming
- The rise of Agile methodologies

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1) Requirement phase
2) Designing Phase
3) Implementation phase
4) Testing Phase
5) Deployment &
6) maintenance Phase
Requirements- Gathering & documenting user needs and system requirements
Design- creating the architectural and user interface
Implementation- writing codes and building the software
Testing- Ensure the software meets quality standards
Deployment- Releasing the software product to the users and customers
Maintenance- Regular updates, support and enhancement.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall emphasis sequential approach while Agile emphasis an incremental approach.
waterfall focuses on requirements, design, and implementations while Agile focuses on flexibility, collaboration, response to changes.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
A software developer is responsible for writing codes and implementing software solutions.
Quality Assurance Engineer develops testing techniques to ensure that the product meets quality assurance
A project manager oversees to the overall planning, execution and delivery of the software products.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples debuggand
Integrated Development Environment (IDE) enables for writing, debugging and testing codes
Version Control System helps to track changes in source code and coordinating work among team members.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
i) changes in requirement- ensure to have gathered all requirements beforehand.
ii) Meeting deadlines- agile methodologies & prioritizing of tasks.
iii) Technical debts- prioritizing of tasks and regularly reassessing projects goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
